## Usage

##### 1. Run MyDexChain:

MyDexChain docker file is stored in dockerhub and ready for use with command: (Please check the version and use as tag rather than latest)

```
docker run -d --rm -p 2020:2020 -v mydexchain:/var/lib/postgresql/ --name mydexchain mydexchain/mydexchain:latest
```

After docker container **comes up** run the command;

##### 2. Follow Blocks:

```
docker attach mydexchain
```



##### 3. Node RestAPI commands :

```
"/setDextracker/{dexTrackerNumber}”
```
- `dexTrackerNumber : DexChain Tracker Number`
```
“/isWallet/{address}”
```
- `address: Dexchain Address`
```
"/balanceWallet/{address}"
```
- `address: Dexchain Address`
```
“/createWallet/{password}”
```
- `password: Dexchain Address password “Please Don’t Forget it”`
```
"/sendTransaction/{sender}&{password}&{receiver}&{amount}&{fee}&{contract}&{description}"
```
- `sender : Sender Dexchain Address`
- `password: Dexchain Address password`
- `receiver: Receiver Dexchain Address`
- `amount: Amount of XMD`
- `fee: Fee of Transaction`
- `contract: DexChain Contract Address (if null please set “mydexchain”)`
- `description: Statements of Transaction (if null please set “null”)`

## FAQ

### Where Can I Run MyDexChain Node?
You can run MyDexChain Node on
- `Amazon Web Services`
- `Azure`
- `Google Cloud`
- `Your Own Server/Desktop`

### Common Problems
These options are settings that change shell behavior. The following table is a list of options that might be useful to you:

| Check | How         | 
| :---: | :---------- | 
| Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?  | Check your docker service is up and running.|
| Block Sync is not working  | Check your internet connectivity. |


### How to Backup the MyDexChain Node?

MyDexCahin maps blocks inside PostgreSQL and it has been addressed inside dockerfile. All the data is saved inside **`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mydexchain`** and make sure that you **backup** the folder.

##### 1. Stop `MyDexChain` Node Docker Container (For Data Consistency):

``` 
docker kill mydexchain
```

##### 2. Copy `/var/lib/docker/volumes/mydexchain` to Backup Path:

``` 
rsync -avzhHP /var/lib/docker/volumes/mydexchain/ /backup_path/mydexchain/
```

##### 3. Start `MyDexChain` Docker Container on the New Docker Host :

``` 
docker run -d --rm -p 2020:2020 -v mydexchain:/var/lib/postgresql/ --name mydexchain mydexchain/mydexchain
```


##### 4. Follow the Blocks on the New Docker Host :

``` 
docker attach mydexchain
```

### How to Migrate the MyDexChain Node to Another Docker Host?
Before migrating your node be sure that docker is `installed on target`.

##### 1. Stop `MyDexChain` Node Docker Container:

``` 
docker kill mydexchain
```

##### 2. Copy Node Files to New Docker Host :

``` 
rsync -avzhHP --rsync-path="sudo rsync" -e "ssh -i key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" /var/lib/docker/volumes/mydexchain/ root@target_ip:/var/lib/docker/volumes/mydexchain/
```

##### 3. Start `MyDexChain` Docker Container on the New Host :

``` 
docker run -d --rm -p 2020:2020 -v mydexchain:/var/lib/postgresql/ --name mydexchain mydexchain/mydexchain
```


##### 4. Follow the Blocks on the New Docker Host :

``` 
docker attach mydexchain
```
